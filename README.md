# SAT Algorithms
A collection of satisfiability algorithms to be merged into LibLogic, eventually.

The programs are guaranteed to work with the benchmarks available at https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html

## How to use
1. Download an archive of tests from the link before and extract it to a directory (preferably a separate one; there are hundreds of files per archive).
